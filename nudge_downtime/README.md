Try moving the scheduled downtimes to be centered on full moons.

Result:  Looks like the moving the downtimes can give a verys slight boost to the effective exposure times, but the number of visits actually decreased, so probably the downtimes are well aligned with bad weather. 

I wonder how good extended forecasts in Chile are? Might be good to have slightly flexible downtimes so if clear darktime is coming up we observe, or if the weather sticks we can start downtime early.
